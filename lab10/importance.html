        <h2>Learning why PMI is important</h2>
        <p>Payment Method Identifier (PMI) helps successful execution of financial
            operations as well as the security of the financial operations. PMI serves as a specific number that
            combines the payment method with the given transaction. By
            introducing PMIs, an organization efficiency is greatly increased as mistakes in payment transactions such
            as debiting the wrong account or providing customer refunds in error are avoided. This boosts the
            level of satisfaction between businesses and customers and saves time as well.</p>

        <p>Another reason that makes PMIs important is due to the development of high tech payment systems. Businesses
            nowadays in the digital era cannot afford to rely on a single payment method contrary to olden times. PMIs
            have is solved how to manage more than one payment gateway and channel revenues effectively. For the
            customers, this equates to a quicker checkout process and swift handling in-case there is an issue with the
            payment.p>

        <p>Lastly, PMIs also help in securing payment transactions in the financial system. They serve as a one-end
            point identity of the user hence makes unwarranted manipulation or re-routing complex. Moreover, most of the
            PMIs are also equipped with a security feature that encrypts the confidential financial details. An added
            security level is very supportive in enhancing the trust of customers more so with the high increase of the
            online and mobile payments.</p>
