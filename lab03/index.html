                <P>I have watched videos and read articles to get to this point but we are finally here. There is a lot
                    of
                    structuring that comes with writing with HTML but these industry standards help keep things
                    organized
                    especially when working in a group setting. By learning how to organize and structure my HTML
                    creating my
                    own webpages will become easier and overall have better results.</P>

                <P>After reviewing what CSS is and how it works, I did find myself struggling to understand the
                    difference between ID and class selectors. I was mostly confused about when to use one instead
                    of the other, a lot longer than I should have, to be honest. This was a fun project overall,
                    though, because I got to mess around with colors and fonts, which to me is more exciting than
                    just inputting the data you want displayed. I hope as I make progress with CSS, I will be able
                    to make some really cool stuff with it.
                </P>
