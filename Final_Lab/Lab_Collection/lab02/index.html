    <P>I have watched videos and read articles to get to this point but we are finally here. There is a lot of
            structuring that comes with writing with HTML but these industry standards help keep things organized
            especially when working in a group setting. By learning how to organize and structure my HTML creating my
            own webpages will become easier and overall have better results.</P>
