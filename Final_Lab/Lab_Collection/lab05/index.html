                <p>I have watched videos and read articles to get to this point, but we are finally here. There is a lot
                    of structuring that comes with writing with HTML, but these industry standards help keep things
                    organized, especially when working in a group setting. By learning how to organize and structure my
                    HTML, creating my own webpages will become easier and overall have better results.</p>

                <h4>What I learned - Lab 03</h4>
                <p>After reviewing what CSS is and how it works, I did find myself struggling to understand the
                    difference between ID and class selectors. I was mostly confused about when to use one instead of
                    the other, a lot longer than I should have, to be honest. This was a fun project overall, though,
                    because I got to mess around with colors and fonts, which to me is more exciting than just inputting
                    the data you want displayed. I hope as I make progress with CSS, I will be able to make some really
                    cool stuff with it.</p>

                <h4>What I learned - Lab 05</h4>
                <p>Learning about the CSS Box Model helped with my coding ability overall. I now understand how to use
                    margins, floats, and different positioning techniques to create better layouts. Also learned that
                    the overall grid is better than float and will continue to practice it. Although annoying to learn,
                    I figured out how to adjust my page for different screen sizes and why it's important. Usually, it
                    seems that it is best practice to consider the mobile version first and then the desktop version,
                    given that so much browsing is done on mobile devices.</p>
