        <h2>PMI and its many purposes</h2>
        <p>Payment Method Identifier (PMI) is used for several reasons, one of them being identification card
            applications while others are for payment transactions. A example being buying something online,
            customers typically allow to register their frequently used payment methods. The Payment Method Identifier
            (PMI) lets the system to understand if the client is making use of a Visa credit card, or a PayPal
            account, or any other payment method. This helps transactions be directed through the correct channel
            without asking the client to input the necessary information again when a transaction is taking place.</p>

        <p>Also, this helps companies struggle less when simplifying their operations. For example, a company that has
            credit card readers and mobile payment options can assign PMIs to track the transactions. This helps a
            refund be made since a unique number helps the company recognize the payment method so that the refund can
            be swiftly processed. This is especially meaningful for businesses being exposed to high levels of
            transactions like e-commerce or big retail chains.</p>

        <p>PMIs are also commonly found in subscription-based services. Some examples are Netflix and Spotify which use
            PMIs to maintain the recurring. PMI helps the system know which card to use for each account when the time
            comes for them to pay, this helps reduce the risk of a service interruption or missed payment. This also
            benefits the user since everything seems seamless after they setup their payment. They don't have to worry
            about it until they need to change the method.</p>
